# fotomatic_fixed
A Codecademy project where I was given a broken website and was tasked to fix it.

When undertaking this project, my priorities were as follows:
1 - identify & diagnose any issues.
2 - implement any necessary solutions.

I am proud of this project because it was the first time I had debugged & improved existing code.
